    <h1>Heart Disease Analysis using MySQL & Power BI</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, I analyzed heart disease risk factors using a structured dataset containing patient demographics, medical history, and clinical measurements. 
        The data was stored in MySQL, and I utilized SQL queries to extract, clean, and transform key variables related to heart disease, including cholesterol levels, 
        blood pressure, ECG results, and exercise-induced angina. Tools & Technologies used: MySQL, Power BI, SQL, DAX</p>

 <figcaption class="caption-white">This SQL query categorizes patients into age groups and analyzes heart disease risk within each group. 
	Grouping by age_groups ensures that the analysis is broken down by meaningful age ranges rather than individual ages. 
	This helps in identifying trends in heart disease occurrence and risk factors among different age groups. Without GROUP BY, 
	the query would return overall statistics instead of detailed insights per age category.

	a unique group), ORDER BY arranges the results based on the total number of heart disease patients in each range. In this case, 
	using ORDER BY totalHeartDiseasePatients ASC ensures that the ranges with fewer patients come first, and the ranges with the most 
	patients appear last. This allows for easy identification of the most and least prevalent blood pressure ranges for heart disease
	patients. GROUP BY organizes the data, while ORDER BY defines the order in which it is presented.</figcaption>

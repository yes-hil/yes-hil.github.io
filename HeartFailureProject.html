    <h1>Heart Disease Analysis using MySQL & Power BI</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, I analyzed heart disease risk factors using a structured dataset containing patient demographics, medical history, and clinical measurements. 
        The data was stored in MySQL, and I utilized SQL queries to extract, clean, and transform key variables related to heart disease, including cholesterol levels, 
        blood pressure, ECG results, and exercise-induced angina. Tools & Technologies used: MySQL, Power BI, SQL, DAX</p>
    
    <h2>Queries with Visuals</h2>

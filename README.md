<h1>Hello and welcome!</h1>

This repository showcases the various projects Iâ€™ve worked on, with a dedicated website that provides an organized and interactive way to explore them. You can browse and download individual projects directly from the website or navigate through the repository, where each project is structured in its own dedicated tab.

Please note that all numbers, figures, and information presented in these projects are purely fictional and used for demonstration purposes only.

Feel free to explore, and thank you for visiting!
